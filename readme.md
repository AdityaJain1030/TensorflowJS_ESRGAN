# Tfjs ESRGAN
A [Tensorflow.JS](https://tensorflow.com/js) wrapper of ESRGAN based off the [ESRGAN Tensorflow Implementation](https://github.com/captain-pool/GSOC/tree/master/E2_ESRGAN). Made with Typescript, Python, Node.js, and Tensorflow.js.

## Quickstart
```
npm i
npm run build
npm run start
```
See more examples in the [documentation](./docs/readme.md)

## Future Releases
I may end up converting this to work in the browser, in a svelte app. Stay tuned!
