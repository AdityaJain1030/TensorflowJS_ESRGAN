# Tfjs ESRGAN
A [Tensorflow.JS](https://tensorflow.com/js) wrapper of ESRGAN (aka Zoom and Enhance)  based off the [ESRGAN Tensorflow Implementation](https://github.com/captain-pool/GSOC/tree/master/E2_ESRGAN). Made with Typescript, Python, Node.js, and Tensorflow.js.

## Quickstart
Make sure you have `node.js` installed. You can check this with `node -v`. If you dont have node.js installed, you can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
```
npm i
npm run build
npm run start
```
See more examples in the [documentation](./docs/readme.md)

## Future Releases
I may end up converting this to work in the browser, in a svelte app. Stay tuned!
